## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive database analysis system for Blinkit's quick commerce operations. The system is designed using Third Normal Form (3NF) principles and includes data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence capabilities.

## Database Schema
The project implements a normalized database with the following tables:
- **Products**: Product information including pricing, categories, and inventory thresholds
- **Inventory**: Stock management with received and damaged stock tracking
- **Orders**: Customer order details with delivery information
- **Order_Items**: Individual items within each order
